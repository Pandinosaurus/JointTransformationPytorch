# JointTransformationPytorch
Generalize Pytorch transforms to an arbitrary number of channels by replacing PIL Images with Numpy Arrays and OpenCV

NB: This is mostly for experimental purpose. Wiser alternatives may be created based on transforms lambda and the functional interface from Pytorch are easier to setup and probably more understandable (higher level with simple verbosity). Check https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/transforms-compose-and-transforms-lambda-are-just-empty-wrapper/3635 . For random operations with lambda transforms / custom transforms, (1) generate a random number (e.g. import random \ nb = random.random() ), (2) generate transform parameters (e.g., for random crop, generate the bounding box coordinates), and (3) apply a not random transform on each image /channel you would like to process passing the transform parameters as argument.
